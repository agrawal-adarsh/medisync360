Perfect. Let‚Äôs now **prepare a complete SRS (Software Requirements Specification)** for our project:

> üéØ **Project:** MediSync 360 ‚Äì Smart Healthcare Management System
> üßæ **Purpose:** Build a full-stack, enterprise-grade microservices-based healthcare platform using Spring Boot (Backend) + React (Frontend)
> üíª **GitHub Note:**
> ‚úÖ Yes, **you SHOULD commit the SRS and all documentation** in your Git repo ‚Äî this is real-world practice in companies for **traceability**, **versioning**, and **collaboration**.

### üìò 1. Introduction

#### 1.1 Purpose

This document defines the functional and non-functional requirements for the MediSync 360 system, a healthcare management platform allowing patients, doctors, admins, and pharmacists to interact within a secure ecosystem.

#### 1.2 Scope

The system provides:

* Appointment booking
* Doctor scheduling
* Patient management
* Billing and invoicing
* Inventory tracking (pharmacy)
* Notifications and audit logging

System will follow a **microservice architecture** and be accessible via web interface (React frontend).

### üß± 6. System Architecture Overview

* Microservices (Spring Boot):

  * User, Appointment, Billing, Inventory, Notification, Gateway, Config, Audit
* Communication: REST + Kafka (for async ops)
* Frontend: React, Axios, JWT
* Persistence: PostgreSQL, Redis (for cache)
* Deployment: Docker Compose + GitHub Actions

---

### ‚úÖ 7. Acceptance Criteria

* System should allow end-to-end flow: register ‚Üí book appointment ‚Üí get treatment ‚Üí pay bill ‚Üí receive prescription
* Admin should view all actions via audit log
* React frontend must consume all microservice APIs securely
* APIs are tested and documented via Swagger/OpenAPI

---

### üì¶ 8. Appendices

* Database ER Diagram (attached separately)
* API Contracts (to be added during design phase)
* UI Wireframes (to be added)
